## Hey ðŸ™ƒ, I'm Galin Georgiev!

I'm Galin Georgiev and I am a student in @codingburgas. My main hobbies right now are making games and getting better at coding languages. I am mainly learning C# at the moment,
so I can make more games and participate in more game jams. I also like ruining my sleep schedule for game jams and then struggling to fix it. Except for C#, I also like C++ and a bit
JavaScript, but I'm not really into Web Development. And at the moment I am also learning SDL 2.

### Hobbies

- Learning Unity, C#, C++. and also SDL 2.
- Participating in Game Jams and Hackathons.
